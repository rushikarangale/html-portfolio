<hr />
<h3>Pushpa</h3>
   <p> Pushpa flower nahi fire hai fireeee<br />
    One of the best mass entertainer of all time!!! first pan india film of the icon star allu arjun and director sukumar.. story of the film is about pushparaj, a mill worker, who is very wise and can go to any extends when it comes to self respect... he later leaves his job and starts working in seshachalam forest which is located near eastern ghats in southern
    Andhra Pradesh for cutting red sandalwood trees (which is illegal) and making money from selling it. there is a small flashback shown of pushpa and his family which shows what exactly went wrong with him & his mother in his childhood... this movie also shows the journey of pushpa from a mill worker to syndicate member of red sandalwood business,

<h3>KGF</h3>
<p>#KGF Must watch movie.. Breathtaking, Benchmark in Kannada industry, Story, Screenplay, Casting full marks. Actors Screen presence is mind blowing. Cinematography is remarkable. Hats off to director's imagination. International standard movie</p>

<h3>RRR</h3>
<p>This was an incredible film. I never heard of this film until Netflix brought it up. I saw clips of the movie and decided it looked pretty good and watched it. I am glad I did, the dancing scene at the party was incredible. Arguably the scene was the best scene in the film. But also the first scene where Ram Charan takes on a mob of people was pretty awesome to watch as well. Overall this is definitely one of the best films of the year combining action, comedy, romance, dancing and great storytelling.</p>
